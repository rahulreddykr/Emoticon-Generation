# Emoticon-Generation-Using-LSTM
Generate appropriate emoticons by feeding in sentences

Have you ever wanted to make your text messages more expressive? This emojifier app will help you do that. So rather than writing "Congratulations on the promotion! Lets go out for dinner. Play ball!" the emojifier can automatically turn this into "Congratulations on the promotion! 😄 Lets get dinner and talk. 🍴 Play ball! ⚾"

First we build a baseline model just using word embeddings, then build a more sophisticated model using LSTM.
